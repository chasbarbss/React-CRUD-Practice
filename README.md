## Application Overview

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React and Vite. It demonstrates how to manage a list of items with a user-friendly interface and mock backend operations.

### Features

1. **Create**: Add new items using a form.
2. **Read**: View a list of all items.
3. **Update**: Edit existing items.
4. **Delete**: Remove items from the list.

### Technical Details

- **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage application state.
- **Mock Backend**: Local storage is used to simulate backend operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **UI Components**:
  - Header: Displays the app title and description.
  - Form: Allows users to add or edit items.
  - Item List: Displays all items with options to edit or delete.
  - Loading/Error States: Handles loading indicators and error messages.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for responsive and modern design.

### How It Works

1. **Loading Items**: On app load, items are fetched from local storage.
2. **Adding Items**: Users can add new items via the form. The new item is saved to local storage.
3. **Editing Items**: Users can edit an existing item. The updated item replaces the old one in local storage.
4. **Deleting Items**: Users can delete an item. The item is removed from local storage.

### Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

### Future Improvements

- Add TypeScript for type safety.
- Integrate a real backend API.
- Implement authentication and user management.
